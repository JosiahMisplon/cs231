Part 1
Passwords cracked: 1162
Total time: 0.867s
Number of hashes computed: 267751
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 1162/267751 = .0043 passwords per computed hash
Time per password cracked: 0.867s / 1162 = 0.000746 seconds per password

Part 2
Passwords cracked: 1133
Total time: 11minutes and 29.7s = 689.7s
Number of hashes computed: 466192417
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 1133/466192417 = .00000243 passwords per computed hash
Time per password cracked: 1133/689.7s = 1.64 seconds per password

Factor by which your time per password lengthened, and why.

The time per password lengthened by a factor of (1.64/0.000746) = 2198 because we essentially had '2' passwords per username, since
each salt is unique to the username, and each username was concatenated with a hashed 'salt+password'. Therefore,
we had a nested 'for' loop that in affect had to do the hashing work of part (1) but for every individual username
instead of once for all of the usernames. So, it seems reasonable that we might have roughly 2000 times more time 
to crack the same number of passwords (since there are 2000ish passwords to attempt to crack).
