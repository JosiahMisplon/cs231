1. ifconfig (ethernet is by eth0 ; wifi is by wifi0)
2. host 137.22.5.8
3. nslookup cs.carleton.edu
4. scp fileToSend.txt mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu
5. lsof -i :80 (for both nmap seems easier if you wanted to get this information about other computers)
6. lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
7. curl https://cs.carleton.edu/ -o "webpage.txt"
8. curl -I  https://cs.carleton.edu/
9. curl -v         (with whatever other parts added seems to show the request and response headers).
